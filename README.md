# DSCI 310 Group Contract

## Team Goals:

- Get all the work done every week and keep everyone updated on the progress. 
- Learn and master all the techniques taught in class and apply everything that we have learned in the project.
- Make a great learning environment for everyone.
- Everybody makes equal contributions and works hard for the team’s success.

## Accomplishments:

- Create an accurate, clean, concise and meaningful project
- Finish the assigned tasks on time before due dates.
- Proceeding through this project with good coordination. 

## Skills to develop and refine:

- Better grasp of the course material by applying the concepts on the project.
- Develop a good work routine and improve our time management skills.
- Discuss and exchange ideas with group members to improve communication skills
- Improve our general proficiency and technical skills with JupyterLab, R, and its useful libraries 
- Improving our insights on statistically analyzing and testing data.
- Improve our proficiency in R sudio, Python, Docker and Github.

## Expectations:

- Engaging and cooperative environment: I believe taking everyone’s input is the best way to move forward and everyone's opinions matter. Every member in the group should have active inputs towards the final work.
- Respecting everyone’s boundaries: I can understand that many of us have midterms and bad weeks so we should be able to work around those and give the members some slack at the same time and also get the work done. Additionally we should not force work onto someone and we should collectively distribute the work.
- Everyone will devote enough time to deliver a high quality final product
- Everyone will complete their assigned tasks and keep tabs on other’s work as well. 

## Policies and Procedures:

- Schedule and attend regular meetings
- Tell others right away if we think we can’t finish our part on time for whatever reason (e.g. don’t know how to do it, sickness, something urgent happened)
- Develop a set of tasks for each team member in our weekly meetings that they need to complete by the decided deadline.
- Use the report and proposal rubric to guide our project and make sure we are addressing all of the various components in our project.
- If an individual notifies the group that they can not attend a meeting within short notice (24 hours before the meeting), the meeting could potentially be rescheduled.

## Meetings:

- We will hold weekly meetings which will be decided based on our set deadlines at 4:00 to 8:00pm on Saturdays. 

## Breach of Contract:

- We will hold our own deadlines according to a set time-line, and we will make sure to meet them. However, in circumstances where a member fails to meet the expectations, a warning will be given. (If the member did not pre-communicate their schedule and ask for accommodation beforehand). Hopefully any issues will be solved through respectful communication among group members. If we are unable to do so, then we will ask the TA or professor for further guidance.
